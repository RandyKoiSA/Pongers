# Pongers - Pong Game
## Information
A pong game using pygame. This project was for me to get an idea of what pygame
is capable of. My goal for this project was to have a completed working game that
can be used as a template for future pygame development. In addition, I wanted to
add JSON files to load in levels and have a save/load file.

## Technologies
* Python v3.7.4
* Pygame v2.0

## Launch
In order to run the game. Have pygame installed and run __pong.py__
